## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Vidit

**Product Manager transitioning to ML Engineering**

~10 years in Product Management. Learning to code through hands-on projects.

### ðŸš§ Code Disclaimer
Most repositories here are **learning experiments** where I:
- Brainstorm problems and test cases
- Discuss approaches and tradeoffs  
- Use AI assistance for implementation
- Focus on understanding rather than perfect code

**Use at your own risk** - these are educational projects, not production-ready libraries.

### ðŸŽ¯ Learning Journey
- Building ML utilities for Indian text processing
- Practicing Python, regex, data structures
- Understanding software engineering best practices
- Preparing for ML Engineering roles
